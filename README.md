## General info

The iNistPack package is an java implementation of the ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000 standard. This java librairie contains methods  for reading, writing, and manipulating the contents of ANSI/NIST data files. 

The java libraires is provide to parse ANSI/NIST files into memory, manipulate designated fields, and write the sequence back to file. This library is very similar to the an2ktool that can be used to work in batch mode. The librarie iNistPack works on Logical data units where specified contents may be extracted, inserted, substituted,or deleted from the file.


The project inception was motivate by the need of having a non commercial Java implementation to create, read, write and update Electronic File Transfert file following the NIST format as describe in the following publication ["NIST Special Publication 500-245"](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/itl/ansi/sp500-245-a16.pdf).
